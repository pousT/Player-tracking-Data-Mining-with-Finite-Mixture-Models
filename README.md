# Player-tracking-Data-Mining-with-Finite-Mixture-Models
This repository contains my undergraduate dissertation. In this dissertation, I present a new machine learning method for organising and explor- ing basketball player tracking dataset SportVU.<br />
Our method describes basketball possessions by a sequence of playersâ€™ actions. We first build a Gaussian distribution model for extracting representative offensive trajectories of players from the raw spatio-temporal path. We combine basketball knowledge with image processing techniques, representing key basket- ball event: Screen, as a pair of co-occured player trajectories. We then employ clustering techniques for action extraction. Each action corresponds to an interpretable type of player movement. We demonstrate how these trajectory clusters can be used to describe individual player behaviour by visualising each group. Leveraging this abstraction of ac- tions, we construct a topic mixture model that describes interactions between players, resulting in a description of play structure during each procession with offensive players actively involved in the play.<br />
